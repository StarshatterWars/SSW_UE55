   source:  News,
   file:    "SOLUS - The Provisional Security Directorate of the Independent System of Solus formally requested military assistance from Terellian Alliance Force:Command this morning.  Special couriers ran the Trellis blockade to deliver the message to the Force outpost in the nearby Janek system.  'The official government of this system has been cut off by the illegal blockade of the Trellis Farcaster,' said Adminstrator Lars of the Directorate.  'We have suffered a great deal of damage in the fighting, and we need help to reestablish basic services here.\n\n"
			"Solus has been ripped nearly in two by the bloody civil war that erupted between the Loyalist and Separatist factions of the system government.  Dantari Separatists under the leadership of Senator Masil Gannet, after months of pressing for an official alliance with the Hegemony Prefecture of Renser, have seized much of the Solus star fleet and taken control of the outer worlds of Trellis and Jalah.  The Loyalist faction, although still technically in control of the official goverment, has been trapped on the inner planets Solus and Meridian.\n\n"
			"The Separatist blockade of the Trellis Farcaster has also taken a toll on the many Alliance citizens in the Solus system.  Several Terellian companies maintain major offices on the capitol world itself, and Tal Vesta University runs a stellar observatory near the planet Meridian.  An estimated 375,000 Terellians are trapped by the blockade.  So far they have been unable to convince the Dantari Separatists to grant them safe passage back to the main Alliance systems.\n"

The Ele'aans are an advanced race, but they can be pretty inscrutable at times, even for me.\n\n"

I don't know if he's ever been out as far as Nephrys in all his wanderings.  That's right on the border of Zolon space.  Maybe he's seen or heard something out there...\n\n"

The task force appears to have bypassed the Trellis Sector entirely, somehow translating directly into Jalah orbit.  This may have been achieved by first staging beyond the outer Oort cloud before attempting the final jump.\n\n"
			   "Hegemony TF4.3 is composed of one Dragon class CVBG led by CV-7A4 Manticore, and Broadsword class DESRONs 25 and 26 led by DD-3C40 Claymore and DD-3C42 Ironhelm, respectively.  The Dragon class carrier groups generally field a full complement of intercept, fighter, and attack squadrons, and we believe that TF4.3 is no exception.  On paper, this makes TF4.3 heavier than the Alliance forces assigned to the Solus system.  We have requested a Spectre class DESRON from Fleet to help shore us up, but we are unsure as to how long they will take to arrive.\n\n"

ISS President Marish and newly-appointed leader of the Separatist movement Ayn Toran signed the agreement in the recently repaired presidential palace as Terellian Alliance Fleet Admiral A. Evars looked on.  Notably absent from the signing ceremony was former Separatist leader Masil Gannet, who is believed to have fled the system to return to his native Adantar in the Korius System.\n\n"
			   "The cease-fire agreement has sparked hopes for a lasting peace in this war-torn region that has suffered unprecedented levels of bloodshed in a very short period of time.  The pact is the first step to renewed peace talks to address the fair settlement of ethnic Dantari throughout the system.\n\n"
			   "The deal calls for an open-ended cease-fire between both parties, with independent observers from the nearby system of Silessia to monitor the situation until more permanent agreements can be implemented.  The details of the cease-fire agreement have not yet been made public.\n\n"
			   "Pursuant to the cease-fire arrangement, Hegemony Fleet Task Force TF4.3 is standing down and will abandon the system within hours.  The Terellian Alliance Task Force that has been assisting the official Solusan Government is also making plans to leave the region.\n"

			   "On my orders, under the authority granted to this office by Combined Senate Resolution SR498/37, Alliance forces have begun striking specific military targets in the Renser System to undermine that government's ability to wage agressive war on her neighbors.  The victory of the Solusan people in Operation Highland can not be complete until the hard won peace has been made secure.\n\n"
			   "Now, that peace is gravely threatened by the armed might of the Hegemony.  In fact, we have evidence that the entire Solusan affair was instigated by agents of Renser Prefecture, including former Separatist Leader Masil Gannet.\n\n"
			   "To all the men and women of the various branches of Force now serving in the Renser Theater of Operations, the peace of a troubled region, and the hope for prosperity of all its free people now depend on you, on your determination, and on your abilities.  We trust in your abilities and your resolve, and we know that our trust is well placed.\n\n"
			   "Now that this stage of the conflict has come, the only way to limit its duration is to apply decisive force.  And I assure you, this will not be a campaign of half measures.  We will accept no outcome save victory.\n\n"
			   "Thank you, and good evening."
