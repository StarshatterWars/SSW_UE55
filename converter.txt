No F prefix 

Plain C++ class (not a UObject)

Keep Starshatter core types (Text, List, Color, etc.)

Replace render assets like Bitmap with UTexture2D* (forward-declared in the header)

Use forward declarations aggressively to keep the header light

Add minimal Unreal includes only where necessary (e.g., FVector)

Convert all Vec3 and Point to FVector and include the proper header

Output only the given file 

remove MewmDebug.h (Unreal doesn't support it)

convert all Print type debugging to UE_LOG
