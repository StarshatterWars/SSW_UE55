MISSION

name:       "05. Execution is Everything"
type:       ASSAULT
system:     Renser
region:     Lornas

start:      "04/19:20:00"
degrees:    true

sitrep:     "A group of smugglers broke out of Solus impound three days "
            "ago.  They were able to bypass customs in Khaital and reached "
            "the Lornas asteroid belt this morning.  We believe we have "
            "located their ship, but with all the clutter from the belt, "
            "it is hard to be certain.\n\n"

            "Your element is to sweep the asteroid field and find the "
            "smugglers' ship.  Escort them back to the fleet where they "
            "can be safely apprehended.  We would prefer to take them alive, "
            "but use whatever means are necessary to prevent their escape."

objective:  "* Sweep the Lornas asteroid belt\n"
            "* Escort the smugglers back to the fleet\n"
            "* Return safely to base"
