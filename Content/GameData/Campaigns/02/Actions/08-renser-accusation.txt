CITY OF ULNAR, RENSER - The Renser Secretary of Intersystem Affairs issued a statement this evening accusing the Terellian Alliance of committing illegal acts of agression in the Solus Conflict.

"External involvement in this civil conflict is a clear violation of the Korian Treaty.  Alliance actions are a threat to Solusan sovereignty, and constitute a clear and present danger to the security of the Prefecture of Renser.  Strong measures may be taken to restore normal discourse in Solus."

Policy analysts believe that this statement amounts to diplomatic code words for the commencement of Renser military action in the Solusan conflict.  The statement does not set a timeline for events, but the general feeling is that something is going to happen sooner rather than later.
