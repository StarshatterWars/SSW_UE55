TELMERA CITY, SOLUS - Guns are falling silent throughout the Solus System in accordance with a cease-fire agreement between the Solusan government and the Separatist faction that have been locked in a violent civil war for control of the region.  ISS President Marish and newly-appointed leader of the Separatist movement Ayn Toran signed the agreement in the recently repaired presidential palace as Terellian Alliance Fleet Admiral A. Evars looked on.  Notably absent from the signing ceremony was former Separatist leader Masil Gannet, who is believed to have fled the system to return to his native Adantar in the Korius System.

The cease-fire agreement has sparked hopes for a lasting peace in this war-torn region that has suffered unprecedented levels of bloodshed in a very short period of time.  The pact is the first step to renewed peace talks to address the fair settlement of ethnic Dantari throughout the system.

The deal calls for an open-ended cease-fire between both parties, with independent observers from the nearby system of Silessia to monitor the situation until more permanent agreements can be implemented.  The details of the cease-fire agreement have not yet been made public.

Pursuant to the cease-fire arrangement, Hegemony Fleet Task Force TF4.3 is standing down and will abandon the system within hours.  The Terellian Alliance Task Force that has been assisting the official Solusan Government is also making plans to leave the region.
