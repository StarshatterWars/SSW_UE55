Force:Intel assessment of risk to Harmony Station: Threat Level Gamma (Severe)

Field agents have intercepted communications believed to be for Dantari Separatist strike teams in the Solus or Kalon sectors.  COMINT has completed first (partial) decoding of intercepted transmissions, and believes there is a credible threat to High Value Assets (HVAs) in Solus and Kalon sectors.  Specific times, targets, and methods remain unknown.

Force:Intel recommends additional Force:Space patrols be assigned to the Kalon sector pending further analysis of intercepted transmissions.  Harmony Station in Kalon orbit would make an extremely choice target for a separatist strike.
