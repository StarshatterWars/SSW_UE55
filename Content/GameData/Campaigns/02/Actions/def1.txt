Operation Highland has failed to secure the peace.  Alliance losses have been severe.  The Presdient, with the approval of the Combined Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from the Solus-Renser Theater. Civilian casualties are estimated at more than 10,000 dead and 52,000 injured or missing.

At least one additional fleet is being mobilized from the Hegemony system of Korius.  Force:Command expects that they will translate in system within forty hours.  At that time, the Independent System of Solus will be brought under the direct control of the Marakan Hegemony.
