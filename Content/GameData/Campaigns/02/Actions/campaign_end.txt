Alliance forces have completed operations in the Solus-Renser Theater.  Hegemony resistance has been broken and the Prefect of Renser is meeting with the Alliance Provisional Consulate at this hour to establish terms for a cease-fire and eventual non-agression pact.

All Force:Space units in Third Fleet will be withdrawing from Renser space to predetermined guard points in the surrounding systems.  Force:Command expects to be able to rotate your unit back to home space within a few weeks for replenishment and shore leave.

Well done, Commander!
