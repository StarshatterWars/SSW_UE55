STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Separatist Withdrawal to Jalah
Classified: CONFIDENTIAL DND/CRYPTO

All mobile Separatist forces have withdrawn from the inner planets to Jalah Sector.  We believe they plan to regroup and integrate with Hegemony TF4.3 before resuming the offensive in the Solus and Omane Sectors.  Alliance forces have been doing an excellent job of reducing Separatist fleet strength, and Loyalist security forces believe that they can handle the job of cleaning up the remaining ground based Separatist units.

However, the combined weight of Hegemony and Separatist forces will very likely overmatch our capabilities.  We have received word that Spectre-class DESRON 43 "Shadow" has been assigned to the Solusan conflict, but they will not arrive for at least another fifteen hours.

In the meantime, our plan is to strike the Separatist forces at Jalah before they can regroup.  If we can keep them off balance in a defensive posture there, we believe they will be prevented from mounting an effective attack on Solus.

Simulations suggest that the combined force will try to regroup near Fort Talas Station, using its air cover and defensive fire to protect the fleet.  Remember that our primary objective is to cripple the Separatist fleet, not the Hegemony Task Force, and definitely not the station.  Fort Talas belongs to the Solusan government, and is their primary defensive outpost in the outer worlds.  The station will be vital to their defensive plans after this conflict is over, so we must not cause any more damage to it than absolutely necessary.
