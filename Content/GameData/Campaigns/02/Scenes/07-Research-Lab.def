MERIDIAN - The Tal Vesta University Stellar Observatory in Meridian
orbit has been cut off by Separatist patrols and is facing severe
shortages of food and consumable supplies.  University staff indicate
that the fusion plant on the observatory is still operational, and
that basic life support functions - water, air, and power - are not
an immediate concern.  "Mainly, the students are just hungry.  And
frustrated," said Research Coordinator Alen Tolap.

Student researchers living at the observatory are protesting the ongoing
civil war.  Native Solusans, ethnic Dantari, and even many Terellian
Alliance students have issued a joint statement condemning the conflict
and demanding the resumption of peaceful negotiations.  Thus far, neither
party in the conflict has commented on the student protests.

Alliance Theater Command has promised to make humanitarian aid to the
Meridian sector a top priority.  "We'll find a way to feed these kids,"
Fleet Admiral Evars was quoted as saying. "There's nothing more ornery
than a bunch of hungry college students."
