/***

TRELLIS - The Alliance Third Fleet has broken the blockade of the
Trellis-Solus Farcaster network, a Force:Command spokesperson has
announced.  The minefields surrounding the Farcaster terminus have
been cleared, and several Separatist squadrons have been eliminated
or greatly reduced in strength.

Theater commander Admiral Evars has given official authorization for
the commencement of humanitarian aid traffic to the inner planets. 
Certified non-governmental agencies delivering food, clothing,
medicines, and emergency equipment will receive protective escorts
by warships from the Third Fleet.

"Although the blockade has been broken, there are still several
hostile squadrons in operation near the outer worlds.  We strongly
recommend that only emergency traffic be routed through the Trellis
sector.  Civilian ships are advised to avoid the area until the threat
can be assessed and appropriate actions taken," Evars was quoted as
saying.
