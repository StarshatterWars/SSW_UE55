BOROVA - The Ambassador for the Ele'aan Fusion announced the recall of diplomatic missions to the Marakan Hegemony and the Zolon Empire today.  "Our fact-finding mission to Borova is complete and our findings are conclusive.  We return to Jarnell to present the detailed information directly to the Terellian President and his advisors.  The Zolon Empire and the states of the Marakan Hegemony act together in this invasion, in direct violation of the Korian Treaty.  We recall all of our diplomatic missions to those systems."

Force military analysts insist that they can find no evidence of Zolon involvement in the recent invasion, which seems to be a purely human affair.  "The Zolon Empire has never shown much interest in the core Alliance systems, since they contain no worlds suitable for Zolon life.  Thus far, we haven't detected any prohibited weapons technology in use by the Hegemony invasion force.  Our main goal is to regain control of the system and bring Operation Shining Fortress to a successful conclusion.  Accusing the Zolon Empire of involvement is not consistent with that goal."

The Zolons are a hive-like hereditary empire on the northern border of Hegemony space.  Zolon drones are outwardly similar to Earth crabs, although they evolved in a desert climate without liquid water.  They are less than one meter in height but their six legs can reach a span of over two meters.  The Zolon species is very intelligent, but also very different from humans.  They use neither written nor spoken languages, instead communicating through chemical messengers, gestures, and a form of electromagnetic radiation that may serve them as telepathy.  These differences make it very difficult for Zolons and humans to communicate effectively.
