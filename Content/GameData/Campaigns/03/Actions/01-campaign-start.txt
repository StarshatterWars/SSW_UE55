JARNELL - Just four local months after the success of Operation Highland, the Terellian Alliance has once more been plunged into violent conflict.  For the first time in its five hundred year history, enemy forces have invaded core Alliance systems and attacked civilian ships and property.

"Using the Force involvement in the Solusan-Renser Conflict as a pretext, two key systems within the Marakan Hegemony have formally declared war on the people of the Terellian Alliance," Force:Space Fleet Commander A. Evars was quoted as saying.

The attack has employed two bold thrusts.  The Hegemony Sixth Fleet out of Kolchev System has taken the Independent Civil Protectorate of Haiche and proceeded to assault targets at the Force proving grounds in Janus System.  Simultaneously, the Hegemony Seventh Fleet has left its home port in Loris and bypassed the neutral Silessian Confederacy to begin a rapid invasion of the Borovan Republic (see diagram at right).

Alliance forces are said to be scrambling to defend and hold these two key systems before the invasions can be completed.  Force:Command joint chiefs expressed cautious optimism that early and decisive containment could prevent this conflict from developing into a full scale war.
