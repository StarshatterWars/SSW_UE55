STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Silessian Confederacy
Classified: CONFIDENTIAL DND/CRYPTO

Force:Space Fourth Fleet has been assigned to engage Hegemony forces operating in the independent system of Silessia.  Our main goals are to force the Hegemony to withdraw, while minimizing civilian casualties and property damage.

The Silessian Confederacy has been an outspokenly neutral power in this region for centuries. Official government policy here is to avoid taking sides in any conflict, to the extent that Silessia maintains no armed forces beyond those needed for commercial traffic enforcement.  Neutrality has worked out very well here, and the banking and communications sectors have become quite wealthy.

In fact, they have become so wealthy that the Silessian government is planning a colonial expedition to an undeveloped system far to the north of the Blue Drift region.  They have a colony ship in orbit around the main planet preparing to depart.  We believe the ship is complete and is in the process of boarding the passengers and cargo for the expedition.

Fourth Fleet will have two main defensive priorities during the next hundred hours - defending the colony ship and protecting the swarm of communications satellites that keep the banks and telcos in operation.

More detailed analyses will be made available as the situation develops.
