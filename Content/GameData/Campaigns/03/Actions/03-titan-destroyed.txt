BOROVA - In a devastating surprise attack, Hegemony destroyers and cruisers assaulted the Titan 7th CVBG while in Borova orbit.  The fleet carrier CV-72 Titan is believed lost with all hands, although some of the embarked 21st Tactical Fighter Wing may have been able to escape.  Damage from the fighting was extensive, and several other ships in the Titan battle group may have been damaged or destroyed.

The sudden reversal has staggered the Seventh Fleet.  All surviving units are rapidly withdrawing before Hegemony forces can strike again.  A temporary strategic loss of the Borovan system seems likely at this point.

Force:Space 12th CVBG led by CV-77 Chronos is being readied in Jarnell fleet yards to take over for the Titan.  However, this CVBG is generally reserved for systemic defense.  The 29th Tactical Fighter Wing attached to the carrier contains only half the number of fighters of the Wing it will be asked to replace.
