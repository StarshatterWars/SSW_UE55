Fort Talden Advanced Projects Laboratory Attacked

Force:Intel field agents in the Borovan Capitol report extensive fighting by advance units of the Hegemony invasion force.  The Fort Talden Advanced Projects Laboratory has been attacked and is now in the hands of Hegemony AAF.  Force:Intel field agents are attempting to infiltrate the laboratory and destroy sensitive materials before they can be captured or documented.

Force:Intel recommends Force:Space accelerate deployment of transorbital platforms in Borova Sector.  A package of air strikes could reduce the risk of intel compromise, if assets can be deployed within ten hours.
