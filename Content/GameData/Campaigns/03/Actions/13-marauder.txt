STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Brotherhood of Iron
Classified: CONFIDENTIAL DND/CRYPTO

Advance trading scouts have reported that pirates from the so-called Brotherhood of Iron criminal organization are taking advantage of the Hegemony invasion to prey on civillian transports in the Silessian system.  Reports indicate the presence of small and medium starships as well as several fighter class vessels.  One of the scouts was able to deliver a sensor snapshot of the "Marauder" class starship shown at the right.

The Brotherhood of Iron has been spreading through the unpoliced sectors of the Marakan Hegemony for several decades.  In recent years they have grown more bold and started to establish a presence in the outback.  Most of these characters are wanted by police organizations in both the Alliance and the Hegemony.  Under normal circumstances, we would be expected to follow security protocols and allow civillian authorities to apprehend them.

However, these are no longer normal circumstances.  The President's mandate for Operation Shining Fortress has effectively asked us to assert martial law in the Silessian system.  If you have a safe opportunity to engage Brotherhood forces without undue danger to civillian lives or property then you have permission to take them out.

Good hunting.

Vice Admiral Caldott,
