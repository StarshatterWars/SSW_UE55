VESTAPOL, BOROVA - The Borovan planetary capitol was a scene of fierce fighting in last night's raids by Hegemony advanced ground forces.  Military, logistic, and even civilian targets on the Grand Concourse suffered extensive damage.

Tourist Sara Hunter was an eyewitness to the action: "It was a long night. I'm still a bit shaken. I had just left the Museum of Precolonial Antiquities when Hegemony forces started hitting it with rocket fire. Fortunately, I was able to take shelter in a small shop across from the museum district.  About twenty minutes later, there was a huge explosion and the MPCA was nothing but ashes."  Military analysts believe that low-yield shaped plasma charges were used on some of the targets.

The pattern to the attacks is unclear, and may be the result of spotty intelligence gathering by Hegemony forces.  "I have no idea why they hit the museum district so hard.  I'm just glad I got out before they did," said Hunter.
