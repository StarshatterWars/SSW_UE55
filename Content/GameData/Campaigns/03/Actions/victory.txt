Alliance forces have completed operations in the independent systems of Silessia and Haiche. The Hegemony invasion has been forced to withdraw completely from Alliance controlled space,  and is now preparing to abandon their positions in the neutral territories as well.  Given the circumstances, both Force and civillian casualties have been remarkably light.

The President of the Terellian Alliance will be addressing all members of Force in the field within a few hours.  In the meantime, hold your positions and observe the temporary cease fire.

Well done, Commander!
