Hey Mate,

I don't know if you made the Academy Reunion or not, sorry I missed catching you there.  This has been a bloody awful year.  The trade scouting mission did not go as well as I had hoped.

We were delayed in Nephrys System for two months when the Loris Trade Executive cancelled our return visas.  Nephrys is really out on the rim, I thought we'd never get back.  As it was, it took weeks to find the right sort of contact to forge a new registration for the Maggie and get us cleared through Korius to try the southern route back home.  We had to sneak the long way around - four hops - to avoid the military build-up in Kolchev.

We jumped out of Haiche only a couple of days ahead of the invasion force.  (In case you haven't heard yet, you're under attack mate.)  Right lovely dump you got here in Janus.  Not a decent bar in sight, and I could really use a drink or ten.  We're pretty banged up, but I think we can make Jarnell and maybe sit down at Thralis for repairs.

Good luck, mate.  It's getting nasty out there.

--Jonas
