Councilor Auris hasn't returned from the Ele'aan homeworld, and no replacement has been sent.  We've been requesting an update from the Ele'aan leadership for weeks, but we can't get a straight answer from them (not that there's anything unusual about that).\n\nFinally this morning, everything just went to hell.  Our communications line to the Ele'aan homeworld has gone completely silent.  Half the computer systems in the consulate have gone dead and all kinds of critical files and databases have been deleted somehow. At least my personal system seems to be unaffected so far.\n\nWish you were here right now, I really need to talk to someone I can trust.  Sometimes I think you are the only one left who I can rely on.  I'm worried something has gone wrong... very wrong.\n\nSara" }
