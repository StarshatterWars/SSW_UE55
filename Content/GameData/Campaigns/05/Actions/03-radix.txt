RADIX SECTOR - The Radix system is a small province on the southern edge of Marakan territory.  The system has always been poor in natural resources and as a result has never been able to develop the economic influence of its larger northern neighbors.  But with the conclusion of last month's trade conference, it has become clear that the Radix government is seeking to change all of that.

Over the past few decades, the main trade path in the area has been the Garrison/Isham/Kolchev/Tarsus loop.  As those systems have prospered, trade taxes have risen along with the increased traffic.  At the trade conference, the Radix Minister for Commerce introduced a bold new super-low tariff policy designed to entice crossroads traffic between Garrison and Kolchev as well as Isham and Tarsus to pass through Radix instead of traveling 'around the horn.'
