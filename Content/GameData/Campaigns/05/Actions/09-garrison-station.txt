*************************************

Force:Intel has traced the illegal Technite to an Hegemony military laboratory in orbit about the planet Garrison.  The Garrison system has always been a major storehouse for the Hegemony military, and this station is going to be no pushover.  The station is armored, shielded, and has as much firepower as several heavy cruisers.  In particular, watch out for the gamma ray laser turrets mounted on either side of the central manufacturing sector.

About the only good news is that there is no fighter capability in the system.  None of the planets are habitable, and the Garrison Military Laboratory is only designed to accommodate large starships.  You will of course need to stay alert for carrier-based fighter craft in the region.
