*** FLASH CODED +$TIME 
*** DEADMAN'S ALLEY MILITARY BASE
*** SHADOW CANYON SECTOR 
*** CLASSIFIED: SECRET R3 NTK
*************************************

The latest information we have is that the Hegemony has abandoned their pre-war military outpost in the northern canyons and set up a newer base to the south and east.  My team was in the Radix system several months ago - just prior to Operation Shining Fortress - and we were able to contact some local smugglers before making the jump to Tarsus on the way back home.

The local smugglers call the new base "Deadman's Alley" and that sounds accurate enough.  They have a starbase flightstrip and several barracks tucked away in a narrow passage of Shadow Canyon.  The base is protected by several AAA and SAM emplacements.  The problem for an aerial attack is that the canyons are so narrow they will make it hard for our pilots to evade ground fire on the way in to the strike zone.  The only good news is that the canyon walls also make for decent protection if you can keep your package below the rim wall.

Stay alert down there if you want to make it back in one piece.
