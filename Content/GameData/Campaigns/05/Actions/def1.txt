Operation Nightfall has ended in defeat.  Alliance losses in Isham and Radix have been severe.  The President, with the approval of the Combined Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from the Isham-Radix Theater of Operations.

With the devastating losses on both sides, it seems likely that the war between the Alliance and the Hegemony is destined for a long and bloody stalemate.
