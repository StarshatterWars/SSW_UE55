TIGER BAY, GARDEN, ISHAM SYSTEM - Named for the manta-like Tiger Mara that inhabit its warm coastal waters, the Tiger Bay Colony is today a thriving metropolis.  Tiger Bay was once the original landing site for the Garden colonists.  In the intervening years, a carefully managed urban sprawl has decorated the bright sands and azure waters of the bay.  Glittering office towers and trendy entertainment venues share the tree-lined avenues of the mainland beach cities, while more relaxed appointments decorate the myriad offshore islands.

Just offshore, the littoral waters are dotted with thermal power rigs. In addition to the thermal energy that powers the cities of Tiger Bay, these isolated platforms have tapped into the deep underground pockets of gas that have become a key export for the Isham system.
