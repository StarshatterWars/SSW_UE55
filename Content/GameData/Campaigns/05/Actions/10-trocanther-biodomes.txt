*************************************

The planet Volante in the Trocanther System is "the front door" to the Marakan Hegemony, and it is about the most inhospitable place you could care to find anywhere in space.  The surface is hotter than a blast furnace, and the atmosphere is highly toxic and corrosive as well.  The ceramic composite armor of our fighter craft should be able to withstand the punishing conditions as long as they aren't exposed for too long.

In spite of all that, people actually live on this forsaken rock.  Volante's crust is a storehouse of rare minerals, and a small band of die-hard miners have set up a small colony to exploit them.  The ground sector is rather colorfully named "Hell's Kitchen", and it has a handful of pressurized biodomes for human habitation.  There are also the usual power reactors and support structures needed to keep the domes cool and breathable on the inside.

If the Hegemony were looking for a place to secretly process some highly valuable contraband ore, I can't think of a better one than the Hell's Kitchen mining colony.
