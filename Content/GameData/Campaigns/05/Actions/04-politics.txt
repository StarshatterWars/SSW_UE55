JARNELL, ALLIANCE CAPITOL -

As the war moves farther away from the Terellian core systems and as losses on both sides continue to mount, political action groups are increasing calls for a negotiated settlement and the return of Force to the Terellian home systems.  A rally held before the Senate Building on Jarnell this morning typifies the emotional rhetoric of the growing pacifist movement:

"For how much longer will our young men and women be asked to fight and die hundreds of parsecs from their homes?  When and how will this insane quest finally come to an end?  We've been very patient with Valmar for the past ten months as he has led our entire system on a wild goose chase.  But it is obvious now that he has key Senate sub-committees in his hip pocket," said one rally organizer.

Chants of "We want our government back!  We want our children back!  We want peace back!  And we want them back now!" echoed through the Senate Plaza until security officers were forced to disperse the crowd.

Central to the pacifist movement are the growing questions regarding the mysterious disappearance of the Borovan Archaelith and the inability of Force:Intel to locate large stores of Haichan Technite that were believed to be at the heart of the war.  Without concrete evidence, it is becoming more and more difficult for many civilians to support what they view as simple expansionism.
