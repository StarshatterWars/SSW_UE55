STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Korius System
Classified: SECRET R3 NTK

As you know, the Korian System consists of two major planets surrounded by a sparse outer asteroid belt.  The outer planet, Rhomin, is a medium gas giant with several large moons.  Two of these moons sustain human populations.  The larger inhabited moon is Korius, the system capital.  The smaller moon is Adantar, a cold desert with a thin atmosphere.

Adantar is the homeworld of the ethnic Dantari who started the Solusan conflict.  In fact, there are reliable reports that the Separatist leader Masil Gannet has returned to Adantar and established himself as a local warlord.  Although Adantar itself is heavily armed, we do not have any good data on the strength of space forces in the Korian system.  It does not seem likely that Masil Gannet would be able to construct a new navy in the short period of time he has been in this system.  At the same time, we should not underestimate his financial reserves.  With that kind of personal wealth comes power and the political connections to achieve many ends.
