Traces of Technite Discovered on Tantalus Mining Station

Force:Intel field agents involved in clean-up and security operations at Tantalus Mining Station on Haiche have reported detecting traces of Technite in unprocessed ores stockpiled at the refinery.  Technite does not occur naturally on Haiche, or any other known planet in the periphery.  Neither the Alliance nor the Hegemony have found a way to synthesize it.  The only known sources of the material are archaic; trace deposits were found on Borova on the Baradan Peninsula near the Precursor discoveries.

Further analysis of the ore and the recovered mining equipment from Tantalus Station suggests that the site contained only small amounts of rare earth metals of any value.  It seems unlikely that the Hegemony would risk an illegal mining operation to recover such small amounts of tantalum and iridium.  It appears that Tantalus Mining Station was specifically tasked with recovering technite from Haiche.  It is presently impossible to determine how much technite was extracted, refined, and shipped off planet prior to Force capture of the planet.

Force:Intel does not have an analysis of possible Hegemony motives at this time.  Technite is considered a laboratory curiousity and has no known practical applications.  Borovan technite deposits were of such small quantities that our best materials science expert have not yet fully classified all of its physical properties.
