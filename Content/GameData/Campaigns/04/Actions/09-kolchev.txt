STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Kolchev System
Classified: SECRET R3 NTK

As expected, the Hegemony Third Fleet has fallen back to the Kolchev system.  Once it became clear that they could not contest our control of Tarsus, they elected to abandon that system in hopes that we could be drawn into a trap by attacking them where they are well defended.  Of course, being aware of the trap is our first step in evading it.

The Kolchev system will present some unique challenges for Force Sixth Fleet.  Hegemony forces are scattered across four planetary orbits.  The capital Kolchev is the only planet capable of sustaining a human population.  The northern mountains of the Lovo sector on Kolchev are home to a significant military presence.

Taking control of the Kolchev system will require us to choose our battles.  Always engage the enemy where we can muster a local tactical advantage, and be prepared to withdraw to protect your ships if necessary.  Remember that the Hegemony forces have the advantage of local supplies, while we are stretched across half the Blue Drift region.

Good luck.

Vice Admiral Caldott,
