Operation Firestorm has collapsed. The Hegemony Third Fleet has gained a tactical advantage over the Force:Space Expeditionary Force in the southern systems.

The Alliance has sustained devastating losses in these attacks and has been forced to withdraw.  The Sixth Fleet is attempting to fall back to safe positions within Alliance controlled space. Reinforcements are being called up from the home systems.  With luck, they will arrive in time to hold off the Hegemony counter invasion and force a settlement.
