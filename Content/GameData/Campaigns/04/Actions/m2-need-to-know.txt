Hello $NAME,

Councilor Auris just left here to return home to Ele'aan space.  The Consulate Center feels really strange with no ambassador here.  He said it was just a routine trip, but I have a feeling he isn't planning on coming back.  Now that he has convinced the President that the Zolons are behind this whole war, I think he feels like his job is done here.

But there's more - something else you need to know.  I'm afraid to discuss it on an open channel like this; I don't know who else might have access to the fleet mail feed.  I think it might be really important, I don't know.  I wish I could see you face to face.  I'm afraid to just sit on this information, and I don't know who else I can trust.

I just need someone to tell me that we are all doing the right thing...

Love from
Sara
