STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Operation Firestorm
Classified: SECRET R3 NTK

Our strategic plan for Operation Firestorm is to employ the Sixth and Seventh Fleets as two arms in a giant pincer maneuver.  The Sixth Fleet is currently deployed in the southern systems.  By proceding from Haiche to Ostara to Tarsus, we have effectively flanked the heavier concentration of Hegemony firepower in the Kolchev system.  The Seventh Fleet is already in Silessia on its way to the Loris system in the north.  Once Loris is secure, the Seventh Fleet will proceed south to Korius and Adantar.  Additional Fleets will then become available to backfill and secure the territory we have won.

For those of you in the Sixth Fleet, we expect Tarsus to be an easy victory.  The system is isolated and not well defended.  However, the Kolchev system will be no pushover.  There is a major Hegemony starbase in the northern mountains of Lovo Sector on Kolchev, and we expect their star fleet to fall back and regroup in that system as soon as we begin to gain the upper hand in Tarsus.

Finally, it looks like we will have to watch out for Zolon involvement after all.  Zolon fighters and cruisers played a key role in eliminating the peace conference and escalating the war.  Unfortunately, we have very little information on their capabilities.  Reports from  officers who engaged them in the Tarsus system suggest that their ships are very tough and have weapons at least the equal of our own.  They also seem to have developed some new type of faster than light drive.  We assume that is operates on a principle entirely different than our own quantum drives.  Even their smallest fighters have independent FTL capability, so they can both run and fight.

Well, we have a job to do.  Stay sharp out there.
