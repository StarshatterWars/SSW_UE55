STRATPLAN BRIEFING

Subject: Zolon Ambassador
Classified: SECRET R2 NTK

The Zolon Ambassador to Tarsus has offered to broker peace negotiations between the Terellian Alliance and the Marakan Hegemony.  The Zolons have invited representatives from both sides to meet aboard their Consular Starship in Tarsus orbit to discuss plans to de-escalate the current conflict.

Militarily, this seems an unlikely plan.  It is doubtful that the Hegemony is ready to make serious concessions at this time as they probably see the outcome of the war to be too hard to predict.  They are still very much in this fight, and they have not yet lost any real territory to our advance.

Politically however, this is not an opportunity that we can simply ignore.  A diplomatic team has been dispatched from Haiche to rendezvous with Sixth Fleet.  The fleet will then translate to the Tarsus system to rendezvous with the Zolon Consular Starship.

Realistically, we knew we would have to invade Tarsus in force sooner or later.  This development simply advances the time table and gives us an opportunity to enter the system relatively unopposed.

Note that we are now operating under a flag of truce until the negotiations have concluded.  Rules of Engagement: Do not fire unless you are fired upon.  Stay alert.  There will be plenty of Hegemony warships in the area.  Anything could happen if we are not careful.

Vice Admiral Caldott,
