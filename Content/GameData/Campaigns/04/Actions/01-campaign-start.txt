JARNELL - The ink is barely dry on the cease-fire order that brought a halt to Operation Shining Fortress but Alliance Force starships are once again being sent into harm's way.  The Sixth Fleet left Force Yards in Jarnell several days ago, and after proceeding along the southern route through recently-liberated Haiche, has begun operations in the Hegemony border system of Ostara.

Force officials have so far downplayed the importance of this fleet engagement.  "Shortly before the war began, long range scouts detected a secret Hegemony base in the Ostara system, near the planet Aram.  In the interest of establishing a safe buffer zone for the Haiche Protectorate, we are taking this opportunity to encourage those forces to return to the core Hegemony worlds," Force:Space Fleet Commander A. Evars was quoted as saying.

Independent military analysts at the prestigious Wiggen Institute think-tank have observed that another Alliance fleet is also being prepared in the Paragon system.  "Having two additional expeditionary fleets in operation right now strongly suggests that Force is preparing for a wider conflict in the near future," said Chu Vo of the institute.

Force:Command joint chiefs declined to comment on speculations that a major offensive was being planned against the middle Hegemony systems.  "I have no information on that subject that I can share with you at the present time," said Evars.
