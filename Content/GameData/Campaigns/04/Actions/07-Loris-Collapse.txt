*** LORIS GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE
*** LORIS SECTOR 
*** CLASSIFIED: SECRET R3 NTK
*************************************

The Government of the Loris System has Collapsed.

Force:Intel field agents report that the system is in a state of near-anarchy.  Hegemony military losses sustained during Operation Shining Fortress have eroded popular support for the government.  New demands to defend the system for Operation Firestorm have strained resources to the breaking point.

The Brotherhood of Iron criminal organization saw this an opportunity to attack.  The Loris Trade Secretary was assassinated and replaced, and trade enforcement was weakened as a result.  Brotherhood Marauders and Raiders began preying on traffic in the outer sectors.  Now, fighting has erupted throughout the entire Loris System.  The government has collapsed, and Hegemony military units are attempting to control the political situation and deal with the pirates at the same time.

It is unfortunate that we cannot wait for this local conflict to burn itself out before we invade the Loris system.  Unfortunately, Force Seventh Fleet needs to get to the Korius system to complete the pincer strategy or the Sixth Fleet will be trapped in hostile territory.  Taking control of the Loris system is quickest way to achieve that goal.  And that means that both the pirates and the Hegemony warships are legal targets.
