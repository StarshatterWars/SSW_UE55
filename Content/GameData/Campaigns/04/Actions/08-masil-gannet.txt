TANIS FIELD COMMAND CENTER, ADANTAR -

The Tanis Field Command Center is very well secured.  Only true Dantari are ever allowed within the secret location, and only those of the inmost circle are permitted any knowledge of its location on Adantar.  Rare visitors from the outside are brought to and from the command center in a state of suspended animation, and are rigorously checked for hidden recording devices and location transponders.  Automatic weapons are kept trained on visitors at all times.

Such is the atmosphere that surrounds the Warlord Masil Gannet.  The former Solusan Senator returned to the world of his ancestors following a failed political movement to ally Solus with nearby Renser Prefecture.  When he arrived here, he found the Ulset Nar political organization, originally founded by his grandfather, in a state of disarray.  Gannet quickly used his wealth and political connections among ultra conservative Dantari to reform the group and setup a new base of operations in the Tanis Sector.

Under Gannet's leadership, the Ulset Nar group became focused - one might even say obsessed - with establishing the supremacy of true ethnic Dantari throughout the Korius system.  Although the group claims to be interested only in peaceful leadership of those willing to follow, the massive store of weapons in their desert fortress may give a deeper sense of their true aims.
