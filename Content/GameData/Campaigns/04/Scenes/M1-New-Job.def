This may come as some surprise, but I've been working as a Force:Intel field agent for the past two years.  I got recruited at a traders conference here in Thralis.  Anyway, after that series of scrapes I went through trying to get out of the Nephrys system, my boss decided he wanted to keep me where he could see that I was in one piece.  So he kicked me upstairs and made me an Analyst in Third Directorate.  Now I just get to read the kinds of reports I used to submit.\n\nI guess I'm not that surprised to hear the Zolons have gotten actively involved in the fight.  The Nephrys system was crawling with them when I was out there.  It seems to be their main hangout in Hegemony space.  Still, something seems really off about the \"phony peace treaty\" ruse.  I can't put my finger on it, but something doesn't add up.\n\nGood luck, mate.  Watch your back out there.\n\n--Jonas"  }
